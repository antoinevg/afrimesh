Description: Easy management for B.A.T.M.A.N. wireless mesh networks
 The ability to easily create an IP network in rural areas, developing
 countries and disaster zones can significantly contribute to the ability
 of people to communicate with each other. Afrimesh builds on top of the
 most excellent B.A.T.M.A.N. project to provide a simple management
 dashboard which enables network operators to create and sustain a
 resilient communications network with a minimum of fuss.
