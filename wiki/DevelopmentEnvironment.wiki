Configuring an afrimesh development environment.

= Required Dependencies =

  * gcc 
  * subversion
  * Any httpd  
    ** I'm using apache for a Linux or FreeBSD install and busybox when running under OpenWRT
  * net-snmp 
  * bash   (to be deprecated)
  * curl     (to be deprecated)
  * wget   (to be deprecated)


= Optional Dependencies =

  * openwrt 
    ** you'll need either a copy of the source or the latest toolchain release to build OpenWRT packages
  * mysql 
    ** you'll need this if you plan to work with the radius support


= Platform Specific Instructions =

  * DevelopmentEnvironmentUbuntu
  * [DevelopmentEnvironmentFreeBSD]


= Source =

== Check Out The Sources ==
  * Run:
  {{{
  svn checkout http://afrimesh.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ afrimesh
  }}}

== Install external build dependencies  (TODO - deprecate this step) ==
  * Step 1: Download this: [http://afrimesh.googlecode.com/files/ext.tar.gz ext.tar.gz]
  * Step 2: Move it to your afrimesh source directory and:
  {{{
  cd your-afrimesh-source-directory
  tar xzvf ext.tar.gz
  }}} 


= Compile (TODO - deprecate complexity with platform detection in Makefile) =

In the top-level afrimesh source directory type:

  {{{
  make <platform>
  }}}

Where `<platform>` is one of:  `linux, freebsd or openwrt`


= Install =


= Test Installation =
  * Install /etc/config/afrimesh
