Configuring an afrimesh development environment.

= Required Dependencies =

  * gcc 
  * Any httpd  (I'm using apache for a server install and busybox when running on a router)
  * net-snmp 
  * bash   (to be deprecated)
  * curl     (to be deprecated)
  * wget   (to be deprecated)

  
= Optional Dependencies =

  * openwrt (you'll need either a copy of the source or the latest toolchain release to build OpenWRT packages)
  * mysql (if you plan to work with the radius support)
