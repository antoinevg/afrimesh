= Afrimesh Dashboard Installation =

== Step 1 - Install the afrimesh-dashboard package ==

=== Ubuntu ===

Before you can install the afrimesh-dashboard package you will
need to add the Afrimesh package archive & keys to the system.

To do this, please open up a
Terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) and run:

  {{{
  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 50CFBA3E
  sudo sh -c "echo deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/afrimesh/ppa/ubuntu hardy main >> /etc/apt/sources.list"
  sudo apt-get update
  }}}

You should only ever have to do this once to access all present
and future Afrimesh releases from your machine.

Finally, you can install the afrimesh-dashboard package by running:

  {{{
  sudo apt-get install afrimesh-dashboard
  }}}

Alternatively, afrimesh-dashboard should now also be available
for installation from Synaptic Package
Manager. (System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager)
