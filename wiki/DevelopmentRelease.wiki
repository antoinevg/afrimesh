#summary How to release a new version of afrimesh
#labels Phase-Implementation

From time to time this software will try to escape into the world.

By following these instructions you can make this a painless process for everyone involved every time.


= Subversion =
* Run:
{{{
  tag repository
}}}


= OpenWRT =
* Bump revision number:
{{{
  vi package-scripts/openwrt/afrimesh/Makefile
  # edit PKG_REV to reflect the correct subversion revision number
}}}

* Build binary packages and firmware images
{{{
  cd <kamikaze directory>
  make clean world
}}}

* Upload to repository
{{{
  scp -r bin/* antoine@downloads.afrimesh.org
}}}

* Update OpenWRT
While we maintain a mirror of the openwrt package scripts in the afrimesh source tree the master version lives in the openwrt repository and will need to be updated to reflect new releases.
